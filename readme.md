Usage
=====
Haml files should be placed in the src/haml directory, and will be compiled into the /public directory.  Sass/scss files should be placed in the src/stylesheets directory, and then will be compiled into the /public/stylesheets directory.

Then simply run 'rake watch' and the system will watch for changes and compile automatically.
